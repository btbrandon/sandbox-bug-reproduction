# Direct Project - MapLibre Test

This is a direct Remix project with MapLibre GL JS that shows map points. This represents how the code should work when run directly in your IDE.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser

## Expected Behavior

You should see:

- A map centered on San Francisco
- 4 red circular markers with numbers 1-4 on the map
- The markers should be clearly visible and interactive

## Features

- Uses MapLibre GL JS for mapping
- Shows multiple point markers on the map
- Each marker displays a number and has a tooltip with the point name
- Built with Remix + Vite + React

## Notes

This project uses the exact same base files as the sandbox environment, so any differences in behavior between this and the sandbox preview indicate issues with the sandbox setup.
